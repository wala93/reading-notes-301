# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## When Women Stopped Coding

A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women.
And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984,
something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, 
even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University,
which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common,
computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.
Here are five themes that have emerged from those conversations: 

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
* Diverse companies perform better
* Companies are losing out on great talent 
* Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
* It’s the right thing to do While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven
  by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily
  by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.
