# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Is a series of posts designed to prepare candidates for common questions;
It works with calculations as solving mathematical functions by following
general mathematical rules and regulations. It looks like its first 
solution game using Solve Death.

There are several benefits to pure functions:

They're easier to reason about and debug because they don't depend on mutable state.
The return value can be cached or "memoized" to avoid recomputing it in the future.
They're easier to test because there are no dependencies (such as logging, Ajax, database, etc.) that need to be mocked.

The same thing goes when using a Map or a Set. We can avoid mutator methods by returning a new Map or Set with the desired changes.

We use it when we want to break a link(URL) into fewer parts.
use it to generate the random names for accounts.
