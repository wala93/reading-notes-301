# Node, Express, and APIs

 ## Node.js
 What Is Node and When Should I Use It ? 
 Node.js is a peice of software written in javascript
 > Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine 
 In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime transform your code from its code to machine language.
 
 Node.js is written in JavaScript, using a two-way, asynchronous I / O pattern to reduce costs and maximize scalability. Unlike most Javascript programs, they do not run on the web browser, but instead are run on the server side.
 
 so, if project contain file.json that mean it use Node.js so we use npm (node package of maneger ) then 
 the **Node.js** it’s a platform that fills a particular need.
 package management using **NPM**, a tool that comes by default with every Node.js installation. 
 
 Some of the most useful npm modules today are:

## express :
its a way to node your project using  command in terminal like :  
npm i express => so in this way you install dependencies .

**Application programming Interface**
in simple words we can say software products exchange data and functionalities
via machine-readable interfaces – APIs (application programming interfaces).
