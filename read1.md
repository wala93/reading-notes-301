the core of SMACSS is categorization.
By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns.

**in SMACSS there are 5 general categories of css rules**
Base: These are the defaults (html, body, h1, ul, etc)
Layout : These divide the page into major sections
Module :These are the reusable modular components of a design
State :These describe how things look when in a particular state (hidden or expanded, active/inactive)
Theme : These define things like a color scheme or typographic treatment across a site
