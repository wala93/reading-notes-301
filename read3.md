This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion.
It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. 
If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

flex-flow
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex containerâ€™s main and cross axes.
The default value is row nowrap.

.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
